YraX, also known as KittyKat619 and Lily, among other names, is a fictional cat who is the product of a collaboration between the imaginations of many different Geometry Dash players, me included. Althought she does not exist in real life, she does have the ability to influence things that go on in real life. The Geometry Dash account “YraX” is an account that occasionally posts levels made by some of the Geometry Dash players who created her. The account currently has 38 creator points.
